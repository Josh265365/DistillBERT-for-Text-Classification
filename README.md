This was my final year project as an undergraduate at the university of Hull. you can download and read the paper on this  in the repo called "Identification of illegal wildlife trade on social media.pdf".

HOW TO TEST THE MODEL!!

(1.) To test the trained model, open the file DistillBERT which has a pickle file of the final trained model.

(2.) Run all the cells of the jupyter notebook, download the imported libraries if not available on your machine. Test the model with different text.

NB:- Due to the limited amount of the data on illegal wildlife trading the model is not that adavnced yet at recognizing complext context.

5,000 social media post from twitter, instagram and facebook were collected and used  to train the model. The attributes of the data were, Text (Social media post) 
and Trading (1, 0) to indicate if the text is talking about selling illegal items or not.
